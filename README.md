## Week 1:
- I was introduced to a new and interesting subject called **Discrete Mathematics** or **DISMATH**.
- I was also introduced to logic and proofs.
- I've learned that a proposition is a statement that can either be TRUE (1) or FALSE (0).
- I also learned about **Logical Connectives**. 

  Below is a table about Logical Connectives:

| Logical Symbol  |  Logical Operator     | Shorthand | Formula                                       | Logical Expression            |
| :-------------: |:---------------------:|:---------:|:---------------------------------------------:|:-----------------------------:|
| ¬               | Negation              | not       | val(¬p) = 1 - val(p)                          | ¬p                            |
| ∧               | Conjunction           | and       | val(p ∧ q) = min(val(p), val(q))              | p ∧ q                         |
| v               | Disjunction           | or        | val(p v q) = max(val(p), val(q))              | p v q                         |
| ⊕               | Exclusive disjunction | xor       | if val(p) not equal val(q) = 1, otherwise 0   | p ⊕ q  ≡ (¬p ∧ q) v (p ∧ ¬q)  |
| →               | Conditional           | if, then  | if val(p) ≤ val(q) = 1, otherwise 0           | p → q ≡  ¬p v q               |
| ↔               | Biconditional         | iff       | if val(p) equals val(q) = 1, otherwise 0      | p ↔ q ≡ (p → q) ∧ (q → p)     |

## Week 2:
- I learned about a new topic in DISMATH called **Logical Equivalences**.
- I was introduced to the different kinds of laws used in Logical Equivalences.
- These laws are: Identity, Domination, Negation, Double Negation, Idempotent, Commutative, Associative, Distributive, De Morgan's, and Absorption.
- I've also learned **Propositional logic** and **Quantifiers**. 
- Propositional Logic deals with proposition as a whole. (Subject + Predicate)
- Quantifiers indicates the generality of an open sentence in which a variable occurs.
- Quantifiers have two classifications, one being Existential Quantifiers (∃x) which means "There exist" and the other being Universal Quantifiers (∀x) which means "For all".

## Week 3:
- During this week, I was introduced to a topic called **Rules of Inference**.
- The Rules of Inferences are: Modus Ponnens, Modus Tollens, Hypothetical Syllogism, Disjunctive Syllogism, Addition, Simplification, Conjunction, and Resolution.
- We used the different rules of inferences to solve problems such as our homework wherein we have to prove "*Superman doesn't exist!*".
- Our professor also discussed about the different methods of proof.
